Nova is a [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin that acts as a **Quality Gate** for AI-assisted development. It verifies generated code and orchestrates complex multi-project workflows. Independent evaluation, multi-AI cross-verification, and design-implementation gap detection.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (30 seconds)
claude plugin marketplace add TeamSPWK/nova
claude plugin install nova@nova-marketplace

# Start
/nova:next   # Shows what to do next
```

## What Is Nova?

Nova is a **checkpoint inside the AI orchestrator loop**. It verifies that generated code is correct, and orchestrates complex multi-step workflows when needed.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The core principle is **Generator-Evaluator Separation**: the agent that writes code and the agent that verifies it are always different. This prevents the "reviewing your own homework" trap.

## Architecture: Harness Engineering

Nova works by engineering Claude Code's **harness layer** — the hooks, commands, agents, and skills system that wraps around the LLM. Instead of changing what the model knows, Nova controls **when, how, and under what rules** the model operates.

```

| Layer | File | Mechanism | What It Does |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Rules injection** | `hooks/session-start.sh` | SessionStart hook | Injects 10 auto-apply rules into every session as LLM context |
| **Commands** | `.claude-plugin/*.md` | Slash commands | User-invocable workflows (`/nova:plan`, `/nova:review`, `/nova:verify`, etc.) |
| **Agents** | `.claude-plugin/agents/*.md` | Subagent types | Specialist agents with domain-specific checklists |
| **Skills** | `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill system | Complex multi-step operations (evaluation, jury, context chain, orchestration) |
| **MCP Server** | `mcp-server/` | stdio MCP | Exposes Nova rules, state, and tools to any Claude Code session |

**Key distinction**: "Auto-apply rules" means `session-start.sh` injects rule text into Claude's context at session start. Claude then follows these rules as behavioral guidelines — it's prompt-level governance via the harness, not a code-level interceptor.

## Workflow

### Auto Workflow (Natural Language)

Once installed, Nova's Quality Gate **automatically applies to every conversation** — no commands needed. Just describe your task in natural language.

```
"Build a feature" ──→ Auto complexity assessment
                              │
              ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
              ▼               ▼               ▼
           [Simple]        [Medium]        [Complex]
              │               │               │
           Implement       Plan→Approve    Plan→Design
              │               │            →Sprint split
              │            Implement        →Approve
              │               │               │
              ▼               ▼               ▼
        ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
        │Evaluator │    │Evaluator │    │Evaluator │
        │  Lite    │    │ Standard │    │  Full    │
        └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
              │               │               │
           [PASS]          [PASS]          [PASS]
              ↓               ↓               ↓
            Done             Done            Done
```

### Manual Workflow (Commands)

```
/nova:plan → /nova:consult (if needed) → /nova:design → Build → /nova:verify
```

## How It Works: Examples

### Example: "Build a login API"

```
User: "Build a login API"
         ↓
Nova auto-judges:
  1. Complexity → "Auth domain, escalate → Medium"
  2. Writes Plan → Waits for user approval
  3. After approval → Implements
  4. Independent Evaluator subagent runs adversarial review
     → "jwt_secret_key hardcoded → Hard-Block"
  5. Hard-Block found → Reports to user immediately
```

### Example: "Fix this bug" (Simple)

```
User: "Fix the NullPointerException"
         ↓
Nova auto-judges:
  1. Complexity → "1 file, clear bug → Simple"
  2. Fixes immediately
  3. Independent Evaluator runs Lite verification
  4. PASS → Done
```

### Example: "Refactor entire auth system" (Complex)

```
User: "Switch from JWT to session-based auth"
         ↓
Nova auto-judges:
  1. Complexity → "8+ files, auth domain → Complex"
  2. Plan → Design → User approval
  3. Sprint split (Sprint 1: Session model, Sprint 2: Middleware, ...)
  4. Per-sprint: Implement → Evaluate loop
  5. Full verification → Done
```

## Auto-Apply Rules (10 Rules)

These rules apply to every conversation the moment Nova is installed. They are injected as LLM context via the `session-start.sh` hook.

### 1. Automatic Complexity Assessment

| Complexity | Criteria | Auto Behavior |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Simple** | 1-2 files, clear bug | Implement → Evaluator Lite |
| **Medium** | 3-7 files, new feature | Plan → Approve → Implement → Evaluator Standard |
| **Complex** | 8+ files, multi-module | Plan → Design → Sprint split → Evaluator Full |

- Auth/DB/Payment domains escalate one level regardless of file count
- Re-assess if file count exceeds initial estimate during work

### 2. Generator-Evaluator Separation + Pre-Commit Gate (Core)

- Implementation (Generator) and verification (Evaluator) are **always separate agents**
- Evaluator takes an adversarial stance: "Find problems, don't rubber-stamp"
- Lite verification by default; full verification only with `--strict`

**Pre-commit gate**: Implementation complete → tsc/lint pass → Evaluator run → PASS → commit allowed. No deploy before Evaluator PASS (exception: `--emergency`).

### 3. Verification Criteria (5 Dimensions)

| Criterion | What It Checks |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Functionality** | Does it actually work? (compared against requirements) |
| **Data Flow** | Input → Store → Load → Display → Deliver to user — complete? |
| **Design Alignment** | Consistent with existing code/architecture? |
| **Craft** | Error handling, edge cases, type safety |
| **Boundary Values** | Does it survive 0, negative, empty string, max values without crashing? |

### 4. Execution Verification First

- "Code exists" ≠ "Code works"
- "Tests pass" ≠ "Verified" — boundary values must be checked separately
- Environment changes follow 3 steps: Check current → Change → Verify applied

### 5–10. Additional Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|------------|
| **§5 Lightweight Verification** | Default is Lite. Full verification only with `--strict` |
| **§6 Sprint Split** | 8+ file changes split into independently verifiable sprints |
| **§7 Blocker Classification** | Auto-Resolve / Soft-Block / Hard-Block. Forced classification after 2 repeated failures |
| **§8 NOVA-STATE.md** | Immediate update on deploy/test/sprint/blocker/eval results. Known Gaps required |
| **§9 Emergency Mode** | `--emergency` skips Plan/Design. Fix now, verify after |
| **§10 Environment Safety** | Never edit config files directly. Use env vars or CLI flags |

## Commands

Commands provide **additional control** on top of auto-apply rules.

| Command | Description | When To Use |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `/nova:next` | Diagnose project state + recommend next action | Session start, unsure what to do |
| `/nova:plan feature` | Create CPS Plan document | Planning new features |
| `/nova:design feature` | Create CPS Design document | Technical design after Plan |
| `/nova:review src/` | Adversarial code review (`--fast` / `--strict` / `--summary` / `--fix` / `--jury`) | Code quality check |
| `/nova:verify` | Combined review + gap (`--fast` / `--strict`) | Post-implementation check |
| `/nova:consult "question"` | Multi-AI perspective (Claude+GPT+Gemini, `--agent` for no API keys) | Design decisions, architecture choices |
| `/nova:auto feature` | Implement→verify cycle (`--verify-only` / `--emergency`) | End-to-end automation |
| `/nova:init project` | Initialize Nova + create custom agents | New project setup |
| `/nova:init --check` | Measure Nova adoption level | Adoption tracking |
| `/nova:explore` | Auto-analyze codebase, brief where to start | First time on a new project |
| `/nova:orchestrate task` | Auto-orchestrate: design→implement→verify→fix cycle (`--design-only` / `--skip-qa` / `--strict`) | Complex multi-step tasks |

## Self-Evolution

Nova evolves itself. `/nova:evolve` scans tech trends, filters by Nova relevance, and proposes or applies improvements automatically.

```bash
/nova:evolve              # Scan trends + generate proposals (default)
/nova:evolve --apply      # Implement proposals + quality gate
/nova:evolve --auto       # scan + apply + auto-merge within scope
```

### Autonomy Policy

| Level | Example | Automation |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **patch** | Docs improvement, checklist updates | Auto-commit |
| **minor** | New verification criteria, hook improvements | PR creation |
| **major** | New commands, architecture changes | Proposal only |

### Automatic Schedule

Runs automatically via Claude Code remote agent **every Mon/Wed/Fri at 06:00 KST**.

Manage: https://claude.ai/code/scheduled

## MCP Server

Nova includes a local MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes Nova's rules, state, and tools to any Claude Code session — even outside the Nova project.

### Setup

```bash
cd mcp-server && pnpm install && pnpm build
```

The `.mcp.json` at project root auto-registers the server with Claude Code.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|------------|
| `get_rules` | Returns Nova rules (full or by section §1-§9) |
| `get_commands` | Lists all slash commands with descriptions |
| `get_state` | Reads NOVA-STATE.md from any project path |
| `create_plan` | Generates CPS Plan template for a given topic |
| `orchestrate` | Returns agent formation guide by complexity |
| `verify` | Returns verification checklist by scope (lite/standard/full) |

### How It Works

```
Any Project ──→ Claude Code ──→ Nova MCP Server (localhost, stdio)
                                    │
                                    ├── get_rules()     → Full Nova ruleset
                                    ├── get_state()     → NOVA-STATE.md
                                    └── orchestrate()   → Agent team guide
```

The MCP server reads files directly from the Nova installation directory. No API calls, no external dependencies.

## Skills

Skills are multi-step operations that commands invoke internally. They can also be called directly.

| Skill | Description | Invoked By |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **evaluator** | Adversarial 3-layer evaluation engine (static → semantic → runtime). The core verification engine behind all Nova checks | `/nova:review`, `/nova:verify`, `/nova:auto` |
| **jury** | Multi-perspective LLM Jury — corrects single-evaluator bias by running parallel assessments | `/nova:review --jury` |
| **context-chain** | Session continuity via NOVA-STATE.md — preserves context across conversations | `/nova:next`, session start |
| **field-test** | Live testing in real projects using isolated worktrees — leaves no trace | Manual invocation for validation |
| **orchestrator** | Auto-orchestration engine — converts natural language to CPS design → agent team formation → parallel implementation → QA → auto-fix | `/nova:orchestrate` |

## Specialist Agents (5 Types)

Each agent has a built-in Nova self-check checklist.

| Agent | Expertise | Built-in Checklist |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `architect` | System design, tech selection, scalability | Design alignment, non-functional requirements |
| `senior-dev` | Code quality, refactoring, tech debt | Execution verification, env change 3-step, boundary values |
| `qa-engineer` | Test strategy, edge cases, quality verification | Boundary values, Known Gaps, Hard-Block classification |
| `security-engineer` | Vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, auth | Auth/secret Hard-Block, Known Gaps |
| `devops-engineer` | CI/CD, infrastructure, deployment | Post-deploy checklist, blocker classification |

## Session State (NOVA-STATE.md)

Nova maintains context across sessions via `NOVA-STATE.md`. If it doesn't exist, it is auto-generated at session start.

```markdown
# NOVA-STATE — project-name

## Current
- **Goal**: JWT → Session-based auth migration
- **Phase**: building
- **Blocker**: none

## Recently Done
| Task | Completed | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Sprint 1: Session model | 2026-04-01 | PASS |

## Known Gaps
| Area | Uncovered | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Concurrent session limit | Not implemented | Medium |
```

- Located at project root (git root)
- Updated immediately on deploy/test/sprint/blocker/eval results
- "ALL PASS" alone is not enough — Known Gaps must be included

## Blocker Classification

Nova auto-classifies issue severity.

| Classification | Condition | Response |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **Auto-Resolve** | Reversible without external changes | Auto-fix |
| **Soft-Block** | May fail at runtime | Log and continue |
| **Hard-Block** | Data loss, security, user misjudgment | **Stop immediately**, ask user |

Code review additional criteria:
- Runtime crash → Hard-Block
- Data corruption / integrity violation → Hard-Block
- User misjudgment (wrong amount/status displayed) → Hard-Block
- Same failure repeated 2x → Forced blocker classification

## What Nova Catches

Our CI runs a [self-verification test](tests/test-self-verify.sh) against intentionally flawed code:

| Defect | Type | Detection Method |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Missing `GET /api/auth/me` endpoint | Design-Implementation Gap | Design doc vs route handler diff |
| Plaintext password storage | Security | Design requires bcrypt, no hashing in code |
| No email duplicate check (missing 409) | Verification Contract Breach | Design specifies 409, no conflict handling |
| Hardcoded JWT secret key | Security Pattern | Static analysis: string literal |

## API Keys (Optional)

Only `/nova:consult` (multi-perspective collection) requires API keys. Everything else works without them.

```bash
cat > .env << 'EOF'
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
EOF
```

## Install / Update / Remove

```bash
# Install
claude plugin marketplace add TeamSPWK/nova
claude plugin install nova@nova-marketplace

# Update
claude plugin update nova@nova-marketplace

# Remove
claude plugin uninstall nova@nova-marketplace
claude plugin marketplace remove nova-marketplace
```

## FAQ

### When should I NOT use Nova?

- **One-line fixes**: Typos, version bumps — no CPS needed
- **Clear bug fixes**: Stack trace points to cause? Just fix it
- **Throwaway prototypes**: Skip the process
- **Tasks under 30 minutes**: If the cycle takes longer than the task, it's overhead

**Rule of thumb**: If you can hold the entire change in your head, you don't need Nova.

### Can `/nova:consult` multi-AI consensus be wrong?

Yes. Claude, GPT, and Gemini share much training data. Even unanimous agreement may reflect a shared blind spot. The final call is always yours.

### How does Nova work with AI orchestrators?

Nova is a Quality Gate — it verifies, not orchestrates. The orchestrator builds, Nova checks. It's the checkpoint inside their loop, integrated via Claude Code's harness layer.

### What is the MCP server for?

The MCP server lets any Claude Code session access Nova's rules and orchestration guides — even in projects that don't have Nova installed as a plugin. It's a "Nova brain" that's always available locally.

### What is "harness engineering"?

Prompt engineering shapes *what* the model says. Harness engineering shapes *when, how, and under what rules* the model runs — using hooks, plugins, commands, and agents. Nova is a harness engineering tool: it governs AI behavior through Claude Code's plugin system rather than through prompt manipulation.
